Dear Stakeholder,

We would like to present the following startup idea: Pinder. Our team members would consist of: Justin Baksharan, Gavin Martin. Our project proposal is to create "Pinder the Web App"

Our main idea is to take the already existing android app and make it available for all online users without android phones. To do this, we will add a profile page that lets you update (PUT) data for your profile, a matches page with a REACT updating table, a main static page that uses JQuery widgets to let you move between pages, an Adopt a pet page, that lets you choose between existing pet elements, and lastly, an additional page that lets you adopt a pet.

This will be a single page application that gives the illusions of multiple pages by hiding "nav" elements with jquery. It will likely use MongoDB for its data storage. Our overall goal is to expand the user base of our android app, and to assist the local dog loving population.

If you are interested in investing into this startup, please email me at justinbaskaran5@gmail.com.

Thank you,

    Sincerly,

Justin Baskaran
